# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Token Vision is a Python library designed to solve the critical need for offline token calculation and cost estimation when working with image-based AI models. It addresses the challenges developers face when trying to estimate resource usage and costs before making actual API calls.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Offline Token Calculation**: Enables developers to calculate tokens without internet connectivity or API keys
2. **Cost Estimation**: Allows accurate cost planning without spending API credits
3. **Rate Limit Avoidance**: Processes unlimited images without hitting API quotas
4. **Multi-Model Support**: Provides a unified interface for all major vision models
5. **Development Efficiency**: Offers instant results without network latency
6. **Resource Optimization**: Helps developers optimize image sizes and costs before API calls

## How It Should Work
1. **Simple Interface**: Clean API with type hints and comprehensive documentation
2. **Accurate Calculations**: Uses the same tiling and scaling algorithms as official implementations
3. **Multiple Input Types**: Supports file paths, NumPy arrays, and PIL Images
4. **Smart Size Handling**: 
   - No automatic resizing
   - Calculates tokens for original dimensions
   - Provides warnings for large images
   - Suggests optimizations
5. **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple images
6. **Extensible Design**: Support for custom models and pricing configurations
7. **Return Values**:
   - Token counts
   - Cost estimates
   - Optimization warnings
   - Batch processing results
